# Project 2 - Wordle App

Submitted by: Tamara REGALADO QUIROZ

Wordle is an app that lets you guess a word with the amount of letters of your choice and with the number of guesses you choice. It also has an option that makes you guess the word without any hints, since every time you make a mistake it will give you a new one. 

##  Features
- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess
- [x] App displays a reset button on the top left to reset the game (but make no changes to the settings)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had a hard time understanding the syntax of validating and type casting values. However the hints were extremely helpful to breakdown what each method needed and its function.
